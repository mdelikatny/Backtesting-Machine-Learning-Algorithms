Predicting Stock Market Movements with Machine Learning

This code is a Python script for predicting stock market movements using machine learning models. The script uses historical stock prices for the S&P 500 index from Yahoo Finance and applies several machine learning algorithms to predict the direction of the stock market. The performance of each model is evaluated using a backtesting framework, and the results are compared to a simple buy-and-hold strategy.

Data Preprocessing
The script downloads historical stock prices for the S&P 500 index from Yahoo Finance using the yfinance library. The data is preprocessed using the ta library to compute technical indicators, such as moving averages and Bollinger Bands, that can help to predict future price movements. The data is then split into training and validation sets, with the training set consisting of data from 2010 to 2019 and the validation set consisting of data from 2020 to 2021.

Machine Learning Models
The script applies several machine learning algorithms to predict the direction of the stock market based on the preprocessed data. The models used in the script are:

Logistic Regression
Linear Discriminant Analysis
K-Nearest Neighbors
Gradient Boosting
AdaBoost
Random Forest
Support Vector Machines
Multilayer Perceptron
For each model, the script trains the model using the training data and evaluates the performance of the model using the validation data. The performance of the model is measured in terms of accuracy, total number of trades, final portfolio value, final portfolio return, Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown. The script also compares the performance of each model to a simple buy-and-hold strategy.

Backtesting Framework
The script uses a backtesting framework to evaluate the performance of each machine learning model. The backtesting framework simulates trading based on the predictions of the machine learning model and calculates the final portfolio value and return. The backtesting framework assumes that the trader can buy or short the market based on the predictions of the machine learning model, with no transaction costs or slippage.

Results
The script produces performance metrics for each machine learning model for each ticker in the S&P 500 index. The performance metrics include accuracy, total number of trades, final portfolio value, final portfolio return, Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown. The script also produces plots of the cumulative returns for each machine learning model and the buy-and-hold strategy.

Overall, the results of the script suggest that machine learning models can be used to predict the direction of the stock market with reasonable accuracy. However, the script also highlights the importance of considering risk and transaction costs when evaluating the performance of a trading strategy. The simple buy-and-hold strategy often outperforms the machine learning models in terms of risk-adjusted returns and maximum drawdown, suggesting that it may be a more suitable strategy for long-term investors.
